# BFS-2

## Problem1 (https://leetcode.com/problems/cousins-in-binary-tree/)
In a binary tree, the root node is at depth 0, and children of each depth k node are at depth k+1.

Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth, but have different parents.

We are given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and the values x and y of two different nodes in the tree.

Return true if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values x and y are cousins.

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3
Output: false
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4
Output: true
Example 3:



Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
Output: false
Note:

The number of nodes in the tree will be between 2 and 100.
Each node has a unique integer value from 1 to 100.

## Problem2 (https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)
In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:

the value 0 representing an empty cell;
the value 1 representing a fresh orange;
the value 2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return -1 instead.

Example 1:



Input: [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation:  The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
Example 3:

Input: [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation:  Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
Note:

1 <= grid.length <= 10
1 <= grid[0].length <= 10
grid[i][j] is only 0, 1, or 2.

## Problem3 (https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/)
Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

   3

   / \

  9  20

    /  \

   15   7
return its zigzag level order traversal as:

[

  [3],

  [20,9],

  [15,7]

]
